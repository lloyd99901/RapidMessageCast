# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the fact that RMC uses other tools (msg.exe and psexec.exe) to message computers, security updates for the RMC program itself will be rare.
Right now, this project is in development with no released binary yet, but updates (including security updates) will be applied to the following versions:

| Version    | Supported          |
| -------    | ------------------ |
| v0.1 indev | :white_check_mark: |
