# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Updates (including security updates) will only be applied to the latest version available in the Release tab. Older versions will not receive any updates or support.

Due to the fact that RMC uses other tools (msg.exe and psexec.exe) to message computers, security fixes for the RMC program itself will be rare.

| Version    | Supported          |
| -------    | ------------------ |
| v0.0.1 indev | :white_check_mark: | 

Custom builds of RMC will not have support of any kind unless code that is unmodified and used in its intended purpose produces a problem.

If you have found a vulnerability in this software, at this time please raise it through GitHub's issues page.

    The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
    Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
    The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
    Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
    Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
    Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
