//Research into encryption methods and how to implement them in C# is ongoing. This class will be updated as more information is gathered.
//The goal is to implement a secure encryption method that can be used to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and account information.
//Possible encryption methods are, DPAPI (Data Protection API), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and more.
